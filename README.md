# MyStardewMods

This is a repository for all my Stardew Valley mods. Each folder's README file has some more detailed information as well as a link to that mod's page on Nexusmods.com.

I got the idea for this repo format from [danvolchek's StardewMods Repo](https://github.com/danvolchek/StardewMods) so be sure to check out his Stardew Valley mods too!

# Mod Summaries
- [Instant Tool Upgrades](https://github.com/Binarynova/MyStardewMods/tree/main/InstantToolUpgrades): Removes the two-day waiting period for tool upgrades. Clint gives the player their new tool right away!
